# Joseph Prospero's Weather Dashboard
Hello! This is my weather dashboard. It features a search box where you must enter a city name and the page will return a 5 day forecast of the city. It also lets you store those cities while searching up a new one in case you wanted to compare the two cities' weather. The page includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
